            <p>Hello! I'm Pascal Brassat, a software engineering student deeply passionate about building and exploring new technologies. Currently studying at Oakland Community College, I'm on track to graduate with an Associate's Degree in May 2024. While I work as a Server/Bartender at Buffalo Wild Wings, I engage in development work for a game server in my free time.</p>
            <p>Originally from Germany and now residing in the USA, I am fluent in both English and German. This bicultural background has instilled in me a love for travel, further enriching my personal and professional perspective.</p>
            <p>When not immersed in technology, I enjoy fishing, playing video games, and travelingâ€”often to Florida to assist with my family's rental properties. These hobbies, alongside my professional endeavors, reflect my diverse range of interests and dedication to personal growth.</p>
